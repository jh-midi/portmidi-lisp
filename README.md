# portmidi-lisp
CFFI lisp interface to portmidi 2.0 
adapted and actualised from https://github.com/PortMidi/pm_cl

need installation of libportmidi for OSX or Linux before running

and also install quicklisp https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/  this is the simplest way for installing CFFI

I have just tested on sbcl but this should work with all Lisp implementation with CFFI port.


Work in progress ... adding writesysex
